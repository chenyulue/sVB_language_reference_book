Welcome to Small Visual Basic!
===================================

**`Small Visual Basic <https://github.com/VBAndCs/sVB-Small-Visual-Basic>`** (sVB) 
is an educational programming language, created by Eng. Mohammad Hamdy as an 
evolved version of Microsoft Small Basic (SB). It is meant to be *easier* and *more 
powerful* at the same time, to introduce programming basics to kids and beginners 
of any age, provided that they can use the English keyboard on the Windows OS.
